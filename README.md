# Sample empty project

This repo expose an empty project I use to initiate new analysis in a constant way. This [workflow is described here](http://blog.jom.link/implementation_basic_reproductible_workflow.html).

Farhad: I have made some small changes to the J.Muller's work to meet our needs at Monash RSR

# Usage

Farhad: Clone it, rename 'name_of_the_project.Rproj' to an appropriate name (e.g. BCCA_2019.Rproj) and put it in a folder with the same name.

Best served with RStudio and Git.
